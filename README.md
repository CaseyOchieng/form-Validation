# Navigation and validation of forms in flutter

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

The code you shared is a Flutter application that creates a form with an email input field, a password input field, and a submit button.

The form is wrapped inside a Form widget, which is identified by the \_signInkey global key. The text entered into the email and password input fields is controlled by the \_emailcontroller and \_passwordcontroller text editing controllers, respectively.

When the submit button is pressed, the form's validation is triggered using the validate() method of the form's current state (\_signInkey.currentState). If the validation passes, the email and password values are printed using debugPrint().

The code also includes some ignore comments (// ignore_for_file and // ignore:) which are used to suppress specific lint warnings.u
